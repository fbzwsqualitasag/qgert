# Summary
tl;dr. Given two directories `dir1` and `dir2`, containing plot files stored in pdf or png-format, the follwoing command

```{r eval=FALSE}
qgert::create_comparison_plot_report(ps_right_dir = dir1, ps_left_dir = dir2)
```

creates a RMarkdown report (`generic_comparison_plot_report.Rmd`) in the current directory where analogous plots from the two directories are shown side-by-side. The RMarkdown report is automatically rendered into a pdf document (`generic_comparison_plot_report.pdf`) which can also be found in the current working directory.


# Background
Results of statistical analyses are often presented as diagrams. When we are interested in the effect of changes in the analysis on the results, they should be visible in the comparison of the result diagrams. Hence there is a need for comparing the same type of diagram for different context parameters. 


# Purpose
Given two directories each containing a set of plot files stored either as pdf-files or in png-format. Furthermore, we assume that the plot files in the two directories normally come in pairs with the same file name. The function `create_comparison_plot_report()` from the `qgert` package takes the path to the two directories as arguments and shows the plots which are stored in files with the same name side-by-side in a RMarkdown report. This makes the comparison of the two plots a lot easier.


# Result
The result of running the function `create_comparison_plot_report()` is a report that shows pairs of analogous plots side-by-side. An example of such a pair of plots is shown below.

```{r plot-pairs-report, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/plot-pairs-report.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/plot-pairs-report.png")
```

If any of the plot files is missing in one of the directories a placeholder directory showing the string 'NA' is included. This is shown below.

```{r missing-plot-report, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/missing-plot-report.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/missing-plot-report.png")
```


# Customisation
As shown in the summary section above, the function `create_comparison_plot_report()` requires only the two directories to be specified as input parameters. But there are more options with which the generated report can be modified and enhanced. The generated report is based on a template which contains placeholders allowing to parameterize the generated report. The parametrisation allows to insert specific characteristics of a given report into the RMarkdown source file. These characteristics include the title, the author and the output format of the report. The specific information is passed as a list to the argument `pl_repl_value`. Hence the following call to the function `create_comparison_plot_report()` modifies the title and the author in the report. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
qgert::create_comparison_plot_report(ps_right_dir = dir1, 
           ps_left_dir = dir2,
           pl_repl_value = list(title = "Test Generic Comparison Plot Report", 
                                author = "Peter von Rohr")
```

As can be seen from the following screenshot, the title and the author have been modified according to the specified input.

```{r scrsh-title-author, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/scrsh-title-author.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/scrsh-title-author.png")
```
